# Movie_Recommendation_using_colaborative

This repository contains a movie recommendation system based on user preferences and ratings. The system uses collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on the ratings provided by other users with similar preferences.

To use the system, simply clone the repository and run the main.py file. You can then rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5, and the system will recommend new movies based on your ratings.

This recommendation system is a great tool for movie enthusiasts who are looking for new movies to watch based on their personal tastes. It is also a valuable example for those who are interested in learning more about collaborative filtering and recommendation systems.

Please feel free to contribute to this repository by suggesting improvements or new features. Together, we can make this recommendation system even more effective and useful for movie lovers everywhere.
